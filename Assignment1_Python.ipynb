    "2.Versatile and Flexible - Python is used in wide range of applications starting from web development to data analysis and further to machine learning and arificial intelligence.\n",
    "3.Libraries and Frameworks - Python has a vast collection of libraries and frameworks . some of the examples are : Django , Pandas , TensorFlow etc.\n",
